List Columns are column definitions used by lists. These are referred to by the following areas.

- [Backend List Controller](../extend/lists/list-controller.md)
- [Backend Relation Controller](../extend/forms/relation-controller.md)

All list columns are identified as their individual **type** property.

```yaml
mycolumn:
    type: number
    # ...
```
