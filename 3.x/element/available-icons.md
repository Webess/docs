October CMS ships with its own icon library and also includes third-party libraries to make finding a suitable icon quick and easy.

## Phosphor Icons

The [Phosphor Icon pack](https://phosphoricons.com/) is available to use in the administration panel. This library provides a flexible collection of icons for everyday use.

```html
<i class="ph ph-laptop"></i>

When used as an icon definition, the icon name contains both the `ph` and `ph-` prefix.

```yaml
icon: ph ph-laptop
```

```

When used as an icon definition, the icon name contains only the `icon-` prefix.

```yaml
icon: icon-october
